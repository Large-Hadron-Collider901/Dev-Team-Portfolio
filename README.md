## About 

Welcome to our developer team portfolio! This portfolio consists was created with several programming languages including: HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, animations, and transitions, and JavaScript for interactive components. Here we  are sharing some of our projects and showcasing some of the programming skills that we have learned throughout our code school class!

## Objective

In today's ever changing, rapidly evolving world, more and more companies are turning away from traditional hiring methods in favor of a more modern hiring process that involves working with a third party outsourcer to connect them with a dedicated development team. This new approach to hiring a team of developers saves companies time and money through eliminating some of the hassle involved in hiring an in house developer team such as: paying for office space, training and onboarding expenses, purchasing software and resources, and other legal costs. Our developer team portfolio is a collaborative effort to appeal to third party outsourcers who are looking for a dedicated development team to partner with, so that we can work together to find companies whose needs align with our talents!
